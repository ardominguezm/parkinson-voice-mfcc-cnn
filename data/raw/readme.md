# Raw Data Directory

This directory contains the original voice recordings used in the study:

**Domínguez-Monterroza A., Mateos-Caballero A., Jiménez-Martín A.**  
*Automated Detection of Parkinson’s Disease from Voice Recordings Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Synthetic Spectral Image Features*,  
Neural Computing and Applications, 2025 (In review).

The raw data include the CSV files corresponding to the amplitude-normalized audio signals for both healthy controls and Parkinson’s disease (PD) participants. No preprocessing, filtering, padding, or feature extraction has been applied at this stage.

## Dataset Description

### Source

The original voice recordings come from the Spanish PD speech corpus:

**Orozco-Arroyave et al. (2014)**  
"New Spanish Speech Corpus Database for the Analysis of People Suffering from Parkinson’s Disease."  
Proc. 9th Int. Conf. Lang. Res. Eval., pp. 342–347.

Dataset characteristics:

- 100 Colombian speakers  
  - 50 Parkinson’s disease patients  
  - 50 healthy controls  
- Each participant produced  
  - Three repetitions of sustained phonation of the vowel **/a/**  
- Total number of recordings: **300 signals**  
  - 150 control  
  - 150 PD  
- Signals were delivered as raw waveforms and provided here in normalized CSV format.

## Usage Notes

These raw signals serve as the starting point for:

1. MFCC spectral feature extraction  
2. Transformation into MFCC-based spectral images  
3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training  
4. Cross-validation and evaluation pipelines described in the paper
